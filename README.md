# Hi! ðŸ‘‹
### Iâ€™m Rivest Osz,
#### Iâ€™m a programmer who loves low-level stuff.

I live in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·.
I can speak both English and Spanish.
I'm available for any programming-related project (I work on comissions basis).

I am proficient in JavaScript, with over four years of experience, although in the last year I have ben using C++ most of the time.
I have tried a variety of programming languages, including Rust, Go, and assembler. And I'm happy to adapt to many, many more.

I have worked in all kinds of low-resource environments, be it low memory, CPU time, and facilities.
I have programmed on controllers, old (1990<) computers, and old videogame consoles.

If you want to hire my services temporarily, the comission system works as follows:

- We negociate the neds of the project and the price of the comission.
- I will start working on what we agreed, and I will show you how it is coming along.
- As the project progresses, you may request a number of changes.
- We will exchange the final result and the comission payment.

If you have any questions, you can contact me by the following means:

- E-mail: [`rivest-oss@proton.me`](mailto:rivest-oss@proton.me)
- Telegram: [@RivestOsz](https://t.me/RivestOsz)
